# EECE_5644_Marcello
Code for Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition Course

To run the code, you must make the directory /EECE_5644_Marcello/Demo_code15FEBdownload a part of the Matlab path. There are functions used from this folder in the scripts contained in this repository. If there are further issues, I'd suggest making the EECE_5644_Marcello directory and all its subfolders part of the Matlab path as a last resort if Matlab still can't find the functions used.
